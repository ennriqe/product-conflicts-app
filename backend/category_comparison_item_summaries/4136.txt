Key Differences
• Specifications
  - Quality Lines: 4 colors (2 colors per blister)
  - Attributes: Dual ended toothbrush with tongue scrapper, 2 colors per blister
  - Reason: Each side contains information absent from the other (QL’s 4-color note vs Attributes’ dual-ended feature), therefore not equivalent.
