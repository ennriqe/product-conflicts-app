Key Differences
• Color/Scent/Flavor or any form of variant/assortis
  - Quality Lines: Color: White
  - Attributes: None
  - Reason: Color is given as White in Quality Lines but is missing in Attributes.
• Size
  - Quality Lines: 30×30×2.6 cm
  - Attributes: 300×300×27.4 mm
  - Reason: 30×30 cm equals 300×300 mm so length/width match, but height differs (26 mm vs 27.4 mm).
• Capacity
  - Quality Lines: None
  - Attributes: 180kg/400lb/28 persons
  - Reason: Capacity present in Attributes but missing in Quality Lines.
• Specifications

  - Reason: Most points match but LED-display size differs (87×37 mm vs 83×35 mm); extra details in Attributes don't cause inequality, but size conflict does.

  - Reason: Printing information only in Quality Lines.
