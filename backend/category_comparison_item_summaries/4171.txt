Key Differences
• Weight
  - Quality Lines: None
  - Attributes: incl. packaging 67g
  - Reason: Attribute value present but refers to packaging weight, whereas QL has no weight; therefore data do not align.
• Printing
  - Quality Lines: CMYK, 1 Pantone color
  - Attributes: CMYK printing + 2 Pantones
  - Reason: Pantone count conflicts (1 vs. 2).
